Astute readers may have noticed that Obama’s PJAR line is somewhat noisier (visualized in the charts, the line appears thicker than the other Presidents’) - the measurement method was changed for his term which resulted in a different frequency of observations - but overall comparability is the same.

Special thank you to Gerhard Peters at UCSD for making the Gallup Poll data publicly available and easily accessible at https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/data/presidential-job-approval.
