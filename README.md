# visualize-curiosity
Project creation files and database for Visualize Curiosity posts.

Each folder contains the R code, data files, and any other relevant sources used in the creation of my data visualizations and analysis for posts on my website, [visualizecuriosity.com](visualizecuriosity.com).

For references and citations of sources created/assembled by folks besides myself, please see the readme file in the relevant project folder.
