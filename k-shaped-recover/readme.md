NOTES AND CITATIONS:
All facts and figures in this post were created from weighted ATUS data. Weights used come from the WT20 variable in the IPUMS data. As their data description notes, “WT20 does not yield annual estimates. It is designed to provide estimates that are representative of the period from January 1 through March 17 and May 10 through December 31. This weight omits the March 18 to May 9 period because 2020 data were not collected on these days due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This weight is required for analyses that include 2020 data.”

Charts seen in this post were made in R using the tidyverse, readxl, and ggthemes, directlabels, and RColorBrewer packages. Data was downloaded from IPUMS and cleaned using Stata.

In the future, I’d like to revisit this post with two extensions: delve more into the subcategories of time use and see in more detail how the rich and poor vary their activities at a more granular level, and try out a matching procedure to pair rich and poor on dimensions of education, age, race, etc. The latter method would allow for a (potentially) causal comparison of the two groups’ time usage and may provide more interesting insight into how otherwise-similar people diverge in their daily habits on the basis of income. These were my original plans for this post but I had to stop short as personal matters got in the way - but I hope to return to it when there is more data later on!
