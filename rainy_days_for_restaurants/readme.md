A very useful resource for determining which difference of means tests to run and how to do so in R was https://uc-r.github.io/t_test. 

An always-helpful resource for picking complementary colors in charts (used in many of my previous posts as well) was https://coolors.co/. Thank you to the folks at Coolors, as well as my friend Vanessa Wong, for advice on creating charts pleasing to the eye.
