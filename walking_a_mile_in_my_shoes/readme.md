All data used in this post was taken from the Apple Health app. The visuals were made in R, with much of the code inspired or adapted from [Ryan Praski](http://www.ryanpraski.com/apple-health-data-how-to-export-analyze-visualize-guide/). Ggplot2 and RColorBrewer used to create the graphs and create color schemes.
